Integrity Constraints: Keys
Attributes of a column unambiguously identify stored tuples: key
property
E.g., Vineyard for table ORIGIN
ORIGIN Vineyard District Region
Creek Barossa Valley South Australia
Helena Napa Valley California
Château La Rose Saint-Emilion Bordeaux
Château La Pointe Pomerol Bordeaux
Müller Rheingau Hessen
Bighorn Napa Valley California
Combinations of attributes can also be keys!
Keys can be marked by underlining them

"PDF-2, Pg14","Relational Databases – Data as Tables Relations for Tabular Data
Integrity Constraints: Foreign Keys
Keys in one table can be used as unambiguous references in
another table (or even in the same table!): Foreign key, referential
integrity
E.g., Vineyard as a reference to ORIGIN
A foreign key is a key in a “foreign” table

The create table Statement
create table base _relation _name (

...
column _name kdomain k[not null ])
Effect of this command is both
Ito store the relation schema in the data dictionary, and
Ito prepare an “empty base relation” in the database

Null Values
not null precludes null values as attribute values for certain
columns
SQL uses null to refer to null values; we use ?
null has the semantics of “ unknown value ”, “value does not
apply ” oder “ value does not exist ”; however, null itself does not
belong to any domain
null can occur in any column, except for key attributes or columns
marked not null

Additional Notes on Data Deﬁnition in SQL
Apart from primary and foreign keys, SQL allows specifying the
following:
IDefault values for attributes using the default clause,
Icreate domain statement to deﬁne custom domains (data types),
and
Icheck clause to specify further local integrity constraints within the
domains, attributes and relation schemata being deﬁned

Query Operations on Tables
Basic operations on tables that allow computing new result tables
from saved database tables
Operations are combined to form the so-called relational algebra
Mathematics: algebra is deﬁned by a domain and operations
deﬁned on that domain
!for database queries, the contents of the database are the
values (of the domain), operations are functions to compute query
results
Query operations can be freely combined and form an algebra to
perform “calculations on tables” – the so-called relational algebra

"PDF-6, Pg86","The Relational Query Language SQL Special Joins, Sorting, Null Values
Handling of Null Values
Scalar Expressions: Result null, when null value is used in
calculation
In all aggregation functions (except of count ()) null values are
removed before the function is applied
Almost all comparisons with null values result in unknown (instead
oftrue orfalse )
Exception: is null gives true and is not null gives false
Boolean expressions are then based on three-valued logic

Transaction
A transaction is a sequence of operations (actions) that transforms
the database from a consistent state into a consistent, possibly
changed, state, while the ACID-principle must be hold.
Aspects:
ISemantic Integrity: Correct (consistent) DB-state after a transaction
has ﬁnished
IOperational Integrity: Prevent fault caused by ""simultaneous""
access of multiple users on the same data
Saake Database Concepts Last Edited: April 20, 2022 8–9"
21,"Transactions, Integrity and Triggers Term Transaction
ACID-Properties
Atomicity:
Transaction is executed completely or not at all
Consistency:
Database is before the start and after the end of a transaction in a
consistent state
Isolation:
User, who is working on a database, should have the impression
that she works alone on the database
Durability (Persistence):
The result of transaction has to be saved ""permanently"" in a
database after the transaction competed successfully

22,"Transactions, Integrity and Triggers Term Transaction
Commands of a Transaction Language
Begin of a transaction: Begin-of-Transaction-Command BOT
(implicit in SQL!)
commit : the transaction should try to ﬁnish successfully
Isuccess is not guaranteed!
abort : the transaction has to be aborted
Iabort is guaranteed!

23,"Transactions, Integrity and Triggers Term Transaction
Transaction: Integrity Violation
Example:
ITransfer of an amount Afrom a household post K1to another post
K2
ICondition: Sum of the account balances stays constant
Simpliﬁed notation
Transfer = <K1:=K1-A; K2:=K2+A >;
Realization in SQL: as sequence of two elementary changes  
Condition is not necessarily fulﬁlled between single changing
steps!

Simpliﬁed Model for Transactions
Representation of database changes of a transaction
Iread(A,x): assign the value of the DB-object Ato the variable x
Iwrite (x,A): save the value of the variable xin the DB-object A
Example of a transaction T:
read (A,x);x:=x 200;write (x,A);
read (B,y);y:=y+100;write (y,B);
Execution variants for two transactions T1,T2:
Iserially, e.g. T1before T2
I""mixed"", e.g. alternating steps of T1and T2

Serializability
An interleaved execution of multiple transactions is called
serializable, if its effect is identical to the effect of a (arbitrarily
chosen) serial execution of these transactions.
Problem for checking serializability:
Ithere are n!different serial execution orders for ntransactions...
Schedule: Plan of execution for transactions (ordered list of
transaction operations)
